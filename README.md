# MultiThreading-and-Multiprocessing-in-AI-and-ML

## Multiprocessing Overview

### Description
The `multiprocessing.Process` module creates separate Python processes for each seed, allowing them to run concurrently. Each process independently loads the Iris dataset, initializes a `RandomForestClassifier` with a different random seed, and trains the model.

### Execution Flow

1. The main script creates processes for each seed in the `seeds` list.
2. Each process executes the `train_model` function with its respective seed.
3. After starting all processes, the script waits for each process to complete using `process.join()`.
4. Finally, it prints "Model training completed." after all processes have finished.

### Benefits of Multiprocessing

- **Improved Efficiency:** By utilizing multiple CPU cores, multiprocessing reduces the overall training time compared to sequential execution.
  
- **Concurrency:** Processes run independently of each other, leveraging the full capabilities of your CPU cores. This can significantly speed up tasks that are CPU-bound, like training machine learning models.
  
- **Scalability:** Easily scalable to larger datasets or more complex models by adding more processes, making multiprocessing suitable for tasks that require intensive computation.

### Use Cases
This approach is especially useful for tasks like:
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble methods where multiple models need to be trained iteratively with different parameters or seeds.
